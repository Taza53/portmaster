// Package proto contains auto-generated code and some utility methods
// for the protobuf definitions.
//
// Do not modify go-source files execpt generate.go and convert.go in this file.
// Rather update the *.proto files and run `go generate ./...`
//
// go generate must be executed whenever some of the *.proto files changed
// because the resulting auto-generated go-files must be checked into source
// control so plugins can just import that files without being required to setup
// a local protoc environment to generate those files.
